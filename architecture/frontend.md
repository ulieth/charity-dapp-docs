# Frontend Architecture

The charity dApp frontend is a modern React application built with Next.js 14, showcasing contemporary web development practices and seamless blockchain integration.

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework
- **Next.js 14**: Latest version with App Router for optimal performance
- **React 18**: Modern React with concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application

### Styling & UI
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid development
- **DaisyUI**: Component library built on Tailwind CSS
- **Lucide React**: Modern icon library for UI elements

### State Management
- **React Query (TanStack Query)**: Server state management and caching
- **Jotai**: Atomic state management for global UI state
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management with validation

### Blockchain Integration
- **Solana Wallet Adapter**: Wallet connection and transaction signing
- **Anchor Client**: Type-safe program interactions
- **Solana Web3.js**: Low-level blockchain operations

## Architecture Patterns

### Feature-Based Organization
Components are organized by feature rather than type:

```
components/charity/
├── data-access/        # Blockchain interaction hooks
├── feature/           # Complex feature components
├── ui/               # Simple UI components
├── types/            # TypeScript interfaces
└── utils/            # Feature-specific utilities
```

### Data Access Layer
Custom hooks abstract blockchain complexity:

```typescript
export function useProgram() {
  const { connection } = useConnection();
  const { publicKey } = useWallet();
  const provider = useAnchorProvider();
  
  return {
    getAllCharities: useQuery({...}),
    createCharity: useMutation({...}),
    donate: useMutation({...}),
  };
}
```

## Key Components

### Solana Provider
Provides blockchain connectivity to the entire application through context providers for wallet connection, network selection, and program interaction.

### Charity Data Access
Centralizes all charity-related blockchain operations with React Query for caching and synchronization.

### Component Hierarchy
- **Layout Components**: Navigation, headers, footers
- **Page Components**: Route-level components
- **Feature Components**: Complex business logic components
- **UI Components**: Simple, reusable interface elements

## State Management Strategy

### React Query for Server State
Handles all blockchain data with automatic caching, synchronization, and background updates.

### Jotai for Client State
Manages local UI state like wallet connection status, theme preferences, and network selection.

### Form State with React Hook Form
Provides controlled form inputs with validation and submission handling.

## Performance Optimizations

### Code Splitting
Dynamic imports for wallet adapters and heavy dependencies to reduce initial bundle size.

### Image Optimization
Next.js Image component for optimized loading and rendering of static assets.

### Bundle Optimization
Webpack configuration optimized for blockchain dependencies and reduced bundle size.

## Responsive Design

### Mobile-First Approach
All components designed for mobile first, then enhanced for larger screens with responsive breakpoints.

### Breakpoint Strategy
- **Mobile**: < 768px - Single column, simplified navigation
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px - Two columns, expanded features  
- **Desktop**: > 1024px - Full layout with sidebar and multiple columns

## Error Handling

### Error Boundaries
React error boundaries catch and handle component errors gracefully.

### Toast Notifications
User-friendly notifications for transaction status, errors, and confirmations.

### Validation
Form validation with clear error messages and accessibility support.

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
Unit tests for individual components using React Testing Library.

### Integration Testing
End-to-end testing of user workflows and blockchain interactions.

### Accessibility Testing
ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

This frontend architecture demonstrates modern React development practices while maintaining seamless integration with the Solana blockchain.
